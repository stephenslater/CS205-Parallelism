# Visualization

After we compile our analytics using Spark, we want to visualize some of the
key analytics results.
To make this compatible with the Github Pages used for our writeup, we used
the [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) library.
This allows us to have interactive graphs and intuitively see what is going
on in the Science Center plaza.
