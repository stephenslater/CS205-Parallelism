# Crowd Dynamics at Harvard University

Repository for CS 205 Final Project, Spring 2019

## Overview

The Science Center plaza is a very popular area, home to food trucks, students,
and tourists. The Science Center Plaza also has a live stream video feed 24 
hours per day, which you can check out
[here](https://commonspaces.harvard.edu/plaza-webcam).
However, can we use this data to make decisions, such as when to schedule
events in the plaza? However, we only have a large amount of raw video data,

Our project provides real-time crowd analytics with object detection of people
and average interframe and intraframe metrics, such as number of people, group
size, velocity, and location heatmap for a given time period.
We analyze 700 hours of video and then use streaming to compare the real-time
current analytics to the historical data for the corresponding time period in
order to detect interesting events such as large groups of people or fast
movement.
